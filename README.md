# Malaria-Detection
A CNN model which predict whether a cell is parasitized with malaria or not.

## Things I Learned In This Project :-

### Basic
1. How to use tensorflow dataset (in this used malaria dataset)
2. Image resizing and rescaling using tf methods
3. Data processing.
4. Data Visualization using matplotlib and seaborn
5. How Convolution Neural Network Work

### Tensorflow APIs
1. Sequntioal API (tf.keras.Sequential)
2. Functional API
3. Model Subclassing (Using Model and Layer)
4.   Custom Model and Layers

### How to Measure Performance Of Classification Models
1. Precision = TP/(TP+FP)
2. Recall = TP/(TP+FN)
3. Accuracy = (TP+TN)/(TP+TN+FP+FN)
4. Confusion Matrix and How to visualize it using seaborn (heatmap)
5. ROC (receiver operating characterisitc) plot, for finding best threshold value

### Tensorflow Skills I learned :-
#### Callbacks
1. Tensorflow Callbacks (These are method which we can when model is training)
2. LearningRateScheduler (For chaing learning rate)
3. Model Checkpointing (For saving model at best state we want)

#### Mitigating Overfitting and Underfitting
